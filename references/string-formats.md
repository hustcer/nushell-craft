# Nushell String Formats Reference

## String Format Priority (High to Low)

1. **Bare word** — Simple word-character-only strings in data contexts
2. **Raw string** `r#'...'#` — Regex patterns, paths with quotes, multi-line content
3. **Single-quoted** `'...'` — Simple strings without embedded single quotes
4. **Single-quoted interpolation** `$'...'` — Interpolation without escape sequences
5. **Backtick** `` `...` `` — Paths/globs with spaces
6. **Double-quoted** `"..."` — Only when escape sequences are needed (`\n`, `\t`, `\"`, etc.)
7. **Double-quoted interpolation** `$"..."` — Only when both interpolation AND escapes are needed

## Conversion Rules

### Use bare words when:
- Inside arrays: `[foo bar baz]` not `["foo" "bar" "baz"]`
- Path join arrays: `[$dir patches]` not `[$dir "patches"]`
- Match patterns: `match $x { absolute => ... }` not `match $x { "absolute" => ... }`

### Use raw strings when:
- Regex patterns with special chars: `r#'(?:a/|b/)?'#` not `"(?:a/|b/)?"`
- Strings containing both single and double quotes
- Multi-line content without interpolation

### Use single quotes when:
- Simple strings: `'hello world'` not `"hello world"`
- No escape sequences or interpolation needed

### Use single-quoted interpolation when:
- Variables/expressions present but NO escape sequences:
  - `$'Package: ($pkg.name)'` not `$"Package: ($pkg.name)"`
  - `$'Error: ($msg)'` not `$"Error: ($msg)"`

### Keep double quotes ONLY when:
- Escape sequences present: `"\n"`, `"\t"`, `"\r"`, `"\""`
- Need both interpolation and escapes: `$"Line: ($n)\n"`

### Important: Single quotes don't escape

In Nushell, `\'` inside `$'...'` is NOT an escape — it's a literal backslash + quote.

```nu
# Correct — use double quotes when literal single quotes needed
let marker = $"'($pkg)@($ver)':"

# Wrong — backslash doesn't escape in single quotes
let marker = $'\'($pkg)@($ver)\':'  # Produces literal backslashes!
```

### Important: Command expressions require `$` prefix

Strings containing Nushell command expressions wrapped in `()` MUST keep the `$` prefix:

```nu
# Correct — $ prefix required for command expressions
print $'(char nl)Done:'
print $'(ansi g)Success!(ansi rst)'

# Wrong — without $ these are literal text
print '(char nl)Done:'      # Prints literal "(char nl)"
print '(ansi g)Success!'    # Prints literal "(ansi g)"
```

**Rule**: If a string contains `(...)` that should be evaluated as a command, always use `$'...'` or `$"..."`.

## String Type Overview

| Format | Syntax | Escapes | Interpolation | Use case |
|--------|--------|---------|---------------|----------|
| Single-quoted | `'...'` | None | No | Simple strings, Windows paths |
| Double-quoted | `"..."` | `\n \t \" \\` etc. | No | Strings needing escape sequences |
| Raw string | `r#'...'#` | None | No | Regex, strings with quotes, multi-line |
| Bare word | `hello` | None | No | Command arguments, list items |
| Backtick | `` `...` `` | None | No | Paths/args with spaces, globs |
| Single-interpolated | `$'...'` | None | Yes | Embedding variables (preferred) |
| Double-interpolated | `$"..."` | Yes | Yes | Variables + escape sequences |

## Examples

### Array optimization
```nu
# Before
let dirs = [$root, "node_modules", ".pnpm"]
let tools = ["git", "patch"]

# After
let dirs = [$root node_modules .pnpm]
let tools = [git patch]
```

### Interpolation optimization
```nu
# Before
print $"Package: ($pkg.name)"
print $"Error: ($tool) not found"

# After
print $'Package: ($pkg.name)'
print $'Error: ($tool) not found'
```

### Keep double quotes for escapes
```nu
# Keep — has \n escape
print $"\nNext steps:"
let content = "line1\nline2"

# Keep — contains literal single quote and interpolation
let marker = $"'($name)@($ver)':"
```

### Regex with raw strings
```nu
# Before
let pattern = "(?:a/|b/)?"

# After
let pattern = r#'(?:a/|b/)?'#
```
